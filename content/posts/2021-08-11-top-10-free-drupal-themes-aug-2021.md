Drupal is a free and open-source web content management framework written in PHP and distributed under the GNU General Public License. Drupal provides a back-end framework for at least 13% of the top 10,000 websites worldwide – ranging from personal blogs to corporate, political, and government sites.

When I look for best free themes, I try to consider the following criteria. 

1. The Theme must be free to download.
2. It should be able to support the the currently (widely) used Drupal version. (Drupal 7 or 8)
3. It should be backed by an active developer community or a company.
4. Responsive design is a must.
5. The theme must be able to fit almost all the applications/ideas.
6. It must have been reviewed for any security issues by the Drupal security team.

There are many other areas which we can cover but that will not provide us with a good list of themes. Having the above search criteria is sufficient for us to create a site and run it without any issues. At the end of the day, we should focus on user satisfaction. Now, let's look at the themes which fit our search criteria above.

1. BlueMasters (by More than Themes)
2. Corporate Clean (with More than Themes)
3. Danland (by DanPros)
4. Business (by Devsaran)
5. Nexus (by Devsaran)
6. Zircon (by WeebPal)
7. Business Responsive Theme (by Zymphonies)
8. Drupal8 Zymphonies (by Zymphonies)
9. Fontfolio (by Marios Lublinski)
10. Integrity (by knackforge)
