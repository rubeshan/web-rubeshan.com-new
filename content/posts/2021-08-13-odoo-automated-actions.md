Automated actions in Odoo help you achieve a lot more work than what you will get done manually. These Automated actions can be triggered based on multiple conditions or set as a cron job. I have put together some tips and tricks for the Odoo platform.

If you need to install Odoo on a Linux server, [follow this tutorial:](https://www.rubeshan.com/install-odoo-11-on-ubuntu-16-x/)
