Automated actions in Odoo are a useful tool that allows you to automate specific tasks or processes based on certain triggers or conditions. In this tutorial, we will show you how to set up and use automated actions in Odoo.

First, you will need to log in to your Odoo account and go to the "Settings" menu. From there, select the "Automation" option, and then click on the "Automated Actions" submenu.

On the automated actions page, you will see a list of all the automated actions that have been set up in your Odoo account. To create a new automated action, click on the "Create" button in the top-right corner of the page.

On the automated action creation page, you will need to enter a name for your automated action and select a model (i.e. the type of data that the automated action will be applied to). You can also choose to apply the automated action to all records in the selected model, or only to specific records that meet certain criteria.

Next, you will need to specify the trigger for your automated action. This is the event or condition that will cause the automated action to be executed. For example, you can choose to trigger the automated action when a new record is created in the selected model, or when an existing record is updated.

Once you have specified the trigger for your automated action, you will need to specify the action that will be taken when the trigger is activated. This can be any of the available actions in Odoo, such as sending an email, creating a new record, or updating an existing record.

Finally, you can customize the details of the action, such as the recipients of the email, the content of the email, or the data that will be used to create or update the record. Once you are satisfied with the settings for your automated action, click on the "Save" button to save the action.

Your automated action is now ready to be used. Whenever the specified trigger is activated, the specified action will be automatically executed by Odoo. This can save you a significant amount of time and effort, and help to ensure that tasks and processes are completed accurately and consistently.

In conclusion, automated actions are a useful and powerful tool in Odoo that can help businesses to automate tasks and processes, saving time and effort, and improving the efficiency and accuracy of their operations. By following the steps in this tutorial, you can set up and use automated actions in your Odoo account to automate specific tasks and processes.
