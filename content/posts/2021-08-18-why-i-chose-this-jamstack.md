Thanks for checking this blog out. If you have already looked under the hood, you'd notice that this site is a Jamstack installation. Here, I will discuss why I chose this stack and some of the pros and cons about it.

> **Jamstack,** previously stylized as **JAMStack**, stands for [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript"), [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API "API") and [Markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language "Markup language") (generated by a [static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator "Static site generator")) and was first coined by [Mathias Biilmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathias_Biilmann "Mathias Biilmann"), CEO of [Netlify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlify "Netlify") in 2015.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamstack#cite_note-:0-1) In Jamstack websites, the application logic typically resides on the client side (for example embedded e-commerce checkout that interacts with pre-rendered static content), without being tightly coupled to the [back end server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_end_and_back_end "Front end and back end"). They are mostly served with [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git "Git") based CMS or [headless CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system "Headless content management system").[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamstack#cite_note-:0-1) Netlify organizes a conference every year called "Popular Jamstack" that is co-hosted amongst others by Vercel and [Cloudflare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare "Cloudflare") Pages.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamstack#cite_note-3)

If you are still unsure of the white flavour of static site generator I've used, I've chose to setup this site using Jekyll. Initially, I wanted to host it using GitHub Pages but, the free version of GitHub doesn't allow private repositories to host GH pages. That led me to look for alternatives and I came across a service called Netlify.

If I remember correctly, I evaluated Netlify in the past for one of my work's projects but didn't proceed to use it. Now I came back to test it and I loved it. It connects well with the GitHub repo and it can build the code on each commit. Not only Netlify supports https, it has a admin plugin which you can use to add contents from the GUI instead of editing the GitHub repo.

**Here are some of the Pros of using this Jamstack to host this site:**

* Free  to use
* Easy to use and deploy.
* Use the technology you already know
* Quiet a bit of free website templates available for use
* Bit community behind this project.

 

**Here are some of the Cons of using the Jamstack to host this site:**

* Netlify free tier offers only limited bandwidth and build minutes
* Hosting a large site will be difficult.
* Custom content takes a lot of effort to setup
